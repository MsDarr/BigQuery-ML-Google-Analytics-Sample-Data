Project Goal

In this phase of my research project, I operationalized an end-to-end machine learning pipeline in BigQuery to predict whether a website visitor is likely to complete a transaction. The workflow includes: data extraction → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → prediction & insight extraction using BigQuery ML (BQML).

This approach is intentional for my research because it demonstrates a production-realistic setup: the model is trained directly in the data warehouse (no export required), which reduces data movement, improves governance, and supports scalable analytics.
